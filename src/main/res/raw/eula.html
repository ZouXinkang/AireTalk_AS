applicable Service, to You or to any of our other customers if the 
Service were not suspended; or (c) in the event that we determine
that any Service is prohibited by law or we otherwise determine

liabilities, losses (including any loss of data or profits) or any 
other consequences that You may incur as a result of any Service

You notice of any Service Suspension in accordance with the notice

regarding resumption of Services following any such suspension, 
but shall have no liability for the manner in which we may do so 
or if we fail to do so.</p><p>
